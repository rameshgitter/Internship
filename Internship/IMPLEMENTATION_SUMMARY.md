```

### 2. HOD Dashboard (hod_dashboard.php)
``` sql
-- Fetch all students
SELECT si.*, i.change_passcode 
FROM student_info si 
JOIN index i ON si.student_id = i.user_id

-- Fetch all staff
SELECT * FROM staff_info 
WHERE emp_type = 'Staff'

-- Fetch all subjects
SELECT * FROM subjects_pool

-- Get registration count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM semester_registration

-- Get verification assignments
SELECT va.*, si.first_name, si.last_name, s.first_name as staff_fname 
FROM verification_assignments va 
JOIN student_info si ON va.student_id = si.student_id 
JOIN staff_info s ON va.staff_id = s.emp_id
```

### 3. Professor Dashboard (professor_dashboard.php)
```sql
-- Fetch subjects assigned to professor
SELECT * FROM subjects_pool 
WHERE created_by = ?

-- Get students enrolled in professor's subjects
SELECT sr.*, si.first_name, si.last_name 
FROM semester_registration sr 
JOIN student_info si ON sr.student_id = si.student_id 
WHERE sr.subject_id IN (SELECT subject_id FROM subjects_pool WHERE created_by = ?)
```

### 4. Staff Dashboard (staff_dashboard.php)
```sql
-- Get assigned verifications
SELECT va.*, si.first_name, si.last_name 
FROM verification_assignments va 
JOIN student_info si ON va.student_id = si.student_id 
WHERE va.staff_id = ? AND va.status = 'Pending'

-- Update verification status
UPDATE verification_assignments 
SET status = ?, verified_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP 
WHERE assignment_id = ?
```

### 5. Student Dashboard (dashboard.php)
```sql
-- Get student's registrations
SELECT sr.*, sp.subject_name 
FROM semester_registration sr 
JOIN subjects_pool sp ON sr.subject_id = sp.subject_id 
WHERE sr.student_id = ?

-- Get available subjects
SELECT * FROM subjects_pool 
WHERE is_active = 1

-- Check if already registered
SELECT * FROM semester_registration 
WHERE student_id = ? AND subject_id = ? AND session = ?
```

### 6. Password Management (change_password.php)
```sql
-- Update password
UPDATE index 
SET passcode = ?, change_passcode = 1 
WHERE user_id = ?
```

### 7. Registration System (semester_registration.php)
```sql
-- Insert new registration
INSERT INTO semester_registration 
(student_id, subject_id, session, registration_date) 
VALUES (?, ?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

-- Get registration details for PDF
SELECT sr.*, si.first_name, si.last_name, sp.subject_name 
FROM semester_registration sr 
JOIN student_info si ON sr.student_id = si.student_id 
JOIN subjects_pool sp ON sr.subject_id = sp.subject_id 
WHERE sr.registration_id = ?
```

### 8. Verification System
```sql
-- Assign verification
INSERT INTO verification_assignments 
(student_id, staff_id, assigned_date, status) 
VALUES (?, ?, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'Pending')

-- Get verification status
SELECT va.*, s.first_name as staff_name 
FROM verification_assignments va 
JOIN staff_info s ON va.staff_id = s.emp_id 
WHERE va.student_id = ?
```

### 9. Database Statistics
```sql
-- Get total counts
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student_info) as student_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM staff_info WHERE emp_type = 'Staff') as staff_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM staff_info WHERE emp_type = 'Professor') as professor_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM subjects_pool) as subject_count
```
